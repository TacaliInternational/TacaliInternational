 What i want is to make a group of companies  that will focus on major industries:

 	â€¢ Software
	
	â€¢ Research ( Chemicals / Materials / Devices )
	
	â€¢ Finance
	
	â€¢ Transport
	
	â€¢ Logistics
	
	â€¢ Manufacturing
	
	â€¢ Infrastructure
	
	â€¢ Space
	
	â€¢ Fast Food
	
	â€¢ Farming
	
	â€¢ Security
	
	â€¢ Luxury & Fashion
	


And an association to help people.

If you buy the token  my recommendation is : Don't sell TacaliCoin , keep it long term.

Business Vision:

Group 1

Group 2

We will expand in other sectors / industries in Group 3 when opportunity comes.
